## ✅ Project Summary

**LogWaveMonitor** was built to simulate and display live event logs as real-time signal waves. It includes:

* A `.NET 8` Web API backend for ingesting log data
* A `SQL Server LocalDB` database for persistent storage
* A `Swagger` UI for live API testing
* An `RShiny` frontend to display logs as animated signal graphs
* A `simulate_logs.R` script for auto-generating system events

This solution was built by a career-transitioning technologist using **AI engineering prompts** to streamline development. It’s a showcase of how low-code solutions and modern tooling can work together.
